# csgo-simple-linux-cheat
  
This is a simple CS:GO cheat for Linux  
It is not meant to be used as is and is rather a WIP project for educational purposes  
  
## Building
  
Make sure included `tools` script is executable:  
`chmod +x ./tools`
  
Build cheat once using `tools` script:  
`./tools -b`
  
## Loading/Injecting:

Make sure csgo is running before trying to inject  
  
Inject using `tools` script:  
`./tools -l`  
  
## Unload:  

**Currently broken, idk why**

Unload using `tools` script:  
`./tools -u`
